## CLKA: Cross Lingual Knowledge Alignment for Stable Diffusion Models

Standard Chinese stable diffusion model fine-tuning used lots of chinese image-text pairs with end-to-end supervised learning. Here, we use internal hidden states alignment for fine-tuning, which show advantages include: (1) only cross-lingual text; (2) less training and faster convergence; (3) better knowledge transferring.
